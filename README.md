# Lyrebird Quickstart

A new localized Flutter project with Lyrebird installed.

## Getting Started

This is a basic Flutter project, similar to what is generated from `flutter create`,
but with Lyrebird pre-installed and configured to quickly get started with a localized app.

Run `flutter pub run lyrebird` to run Lyrebird.

Use `flutter gen-l10n` to generate Dart code from your `.ARB` localization files.

See the [Lyrebird Website](https://lyrebird.dev) for more information.

- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
